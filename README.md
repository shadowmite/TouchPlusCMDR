Touch+ Camera Application 

Since Ractiv has left us high and dry, this is my personal attempt to get the device they shipped us all to do something near
it was designed for. WORK IN PROGRESS. Please feel free to tinker and suggest anything, I really have no formal knowledge in
Computer Vision technologies so this is a learning experience.

C# - Ported over the ideas of how to unlock the camera from: https://github.com/umarniz/TouchPlusLib/tree/master/src
